<H1>Hi guys!</H1>

<p>Hey, thanks for downloading my program! Here are a few points I would like to make about Ludo:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When playing in double mode, computer's playing strength will be the playing strength set for the first member of the team. For example, it will be the playing strength set for <i>Red</i> in <i>Red+Yellow</i> team.</p></li>

<li><p>Sorry for not providing network support. I do not know anything about network since I do not have much oppertunity to experiment with network (thanks to bulky phone bills-associated with the Internet).</p></li>

<li><p>I am seriously indebted to my brother's Ambar's cooperation in beta-testing. Without his enthuciasm this project might well had many undetected and disturbing bugs. Though we tested it as much as was possible for us and are still carrying out the job, if it happens that this program still contains some bugs (many new features were added recently) please inform us.</p></li>

<li><p>Thank you for using this, and I hope you like it. Any suggestions or comments are welcome. Again, thanks.</p></li>
</ul>
